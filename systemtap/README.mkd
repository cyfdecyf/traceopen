How to generate tag file
========================

Create symlinks to `start-trace.sh` and `mktag.sh` (in the `scripts` directory)
in your working directory.

1. ``./start-trace.sh gcc `pwd` > allfiles``
2. Run the program you want to trace, e.g. start make, which will call gcc
3. Run `mktag.sh allfiles` to build ctags and cscope tags
