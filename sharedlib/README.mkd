How to generate tag file
========================

Create symlinks to `start-trace.sh`, `cfilelist.sh` and `mktag.sh` (in the
`scripts` directory) in your working directory.

1. `./start-trace.sh gcc`
2. Run the program you want to trace, e.g. start make, which will call gcc
3. Run `cfilelist.sh > allfiles` to create a list of all C source and header
   file list
4. Run `mktag.sh allfiles` to build ctags and cscope tags
